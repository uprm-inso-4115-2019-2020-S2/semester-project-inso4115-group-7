Group 7: Movie Ticket Digitalizer

The goal of this project is to be able to create an application, for convenience purposes, for digitalizing a movie ticket.
The end goal is to be able to produce an app that works similarly to Samsung Pay or Apple Pay, but with movie tickets, with eventual extra capabilities such as a hub to purchase movie tickets, see what movies are listed at your local theatre and other features.
